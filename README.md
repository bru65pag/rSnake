# rSnake
Porting snake81 to Rust. **snake81** is my implementation of the classic snake game on a ZX81 in Z80 assembly language. I decided to port it to Rust to learn that language.

## Objectives
* Exact same behavior as the ZX81 version
* Debug the ZX81 version. I have a couple of bugs on the ZX81 version. I wonder if the porting will allow me to find those bugs.

## Questions

* some Graphical User Interface allowing me display the game in a windows that will mimic a ZX81 screen (24 lines of 31 characters)

## Progress
* 15-Feb-2020: Day 1 of this project. I created this README.md file.
